Analyzing the Relationship Between Football Team Market Value and Match Success

Motivation
This project aims to explore whether there is a correlation between a football clubâ€™s market value and its match success. Football clubs invest heavily in players, infrastructure, and management, but does financial power directly translate into better performance on the field? By analyzing match results and team values, this study seeks to answer this question.

Data Source
The data will be collected from Kaggle, primarily using club-level football match results datasets. Additionally, team market values will be sourced from platforms like Transfermarkt. These datasets will be merged, cleaned, and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy before analysis.

Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in team values and performance.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting correlation tests to measure the relationship between financial value and success.

Expected Findings
This project aims to identify patterns in how club market value influences match success. Possible insights include:

Whether higher-value teams consistently perform better.
The extent to which financial investment impacts match outcomes.
Anomalies where lower-value teams outperform expectations.


Deliverables
All findings, visualizations, and insights will be documented in a GitHub repository, including code, datasets, and reports.

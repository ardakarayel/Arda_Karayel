Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between a country's education level and its happiness index to determine whether higher education levels contribute to greater happiness. By leveraging data science, we will investigate whether educational investment correlates with increased life satisfaction. This study will compare education-related metrics (literacy rate, average years of schooling, tertiary education enrollment) with happiness scores to uncover patterns and key influencing factors.

Motivation
This project is important because:
•	Understanding Well-Being: Education is often linked to economic prosperity, but its connection to happiness is less explored. This study can provide insights into how learning contributes to life satisfaction.
•	Policy Implications: If education has a strong effect on happiness, governments can prioritize education reforms for holistic development.
•	Personal Interest: Exploring large-scale social patterns using data science is an opportunity to develop skills in statistical analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Objectives
1.	Investigate the Relationship Between Education and Happiness
o	Explore whether countries with higher education levels report higher happiness scores.
2.	Identify Key Contributing Factors
o	Compare the impact of education with other factors such as GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.
3.	Utilize Data Science Techniques
o	Apply statistical methods and visualization techniques to identify correlations between education and happiness.

Datasets
This project will use publicly available datasets from Kaggle:
1️⃣ World Happiness Report Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness
•	Contains global happiness scores, GDP per capita, social support, freedom index, and life expectancy.
2️⃣ World Bank Education Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/education-statistics
•	Includes literacy rates, mean years of schooling, tertiary education enrollment, and government expenditure on education.
Key Variables in the Dataset:
•	Country: Used as the merging key between both datasets.
•	Happiness Score: Well-being index on a scale of 0 to 10.
•	GDP per Capita: Economic performance indicator.
•	Education Index: Combines mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
•	Tertiary Enrollment Rate: Percentage of people enrolled in higher education.
•	Adult Literacy Rate: Percentage of adults who can read and write.
•	Social Support Index: Measures the strength of community and support systems.
•	Freedom Index: Measures the perceived level of personal freedom.

Methodology
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
•	Merge datasets using the "Country" field.
•	Handle missing values using imputation or by removing incomplete records.
•	Convert categorical variables into numerical representations for better analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Histograms & Distribution Plots → Assess the spread of happiness scores and education levels.
•	Correlation Matrix (Heatmap) → Identify relationships between education, happiness, and economic factors.
•	Scatter Plots & Boxplots → Compare education levels across different happiness scores.
3. Hypothesis
•	Null Hypothesis (H₀): No significant relationship exists between education level and happiness index.
•	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher education levels are significantly correlated with higher happiness scores.
4. Expected Outcomes
•	Identification of potential correlations between education and happiness levels.
•	Insights into whether tertiary education enrollment plays a significant role in happiness.
•	Visualization of global trends linking education with life satisfaction.

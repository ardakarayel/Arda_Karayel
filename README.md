Analyzing the Relationship Between Football Team Market Value and Match Success

This project aims to explore whether there is a correlation between a football clubâ€™s market value and its match success. Football clubs invest heavily in players, infrastructure, and management, but does financial power directly translate into better performance on the field? By analyzing match results and team values, this study seeks to answer this question.

The data will be collected from Kaggle, primarily using club-level football match results datasets. Additionally, team market values will be sourced from platforms like Transfermarkt. These datasets will be merged, cleaned, and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy before analysis.

The methodology includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends in team values and performance. Statistical correlation tests (Pearson, Spearman) will be conducted to measure the relationship between financial value and success. If applicable, a machine learning model may be developed to predict match outcomes based on team valuation.

The expected findings include identifying whether higher-value teams consistently perform better, the extent to which financial investment influences match outcomes, and potential anomalies where lower-value teams outperform wealthier clubs.

All findings, visualizations, and insights will be documented in a GitHub repository, including code and reports.

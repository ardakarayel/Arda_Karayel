Education Level and Happiness Index - Project Proposal

#Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between a country's education level and its happiness index to determine whether higher education levels contribute to greater happiness. Using data science techniques, we will investigate whether investment in education correlates with increased life satisfaction. By comparing education-related metrics (literacy rate, average years of schooling, tertiary education enrollment) with happiness scores, this study seeks to uncover patterns and key influencing factors.

#Motivation

Education is often linked to economic prosperity, but its connection to happiness is less explored. This study can provide insights into how learning contributes to life satisfaction. If a strong correlation is found, governments and policymakers may prioritize education as a key factor for holistic societal development. Additionally, this project provides an opportunity to apply data science skills in real-world analysis, improving statistical and analytical expertise.

#Objectives

Investigate the Relationship Between Education and Happiness

Explore whether countries with higher education levels report higher happiness scores.
Identify Key Contributing Factors

Compare the impact of education with other factors such as GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.
Utilize Data Science Techniques

Apply statistical methods and visualization techniques to identify correlations between education and happiness.

#Datasets

This project will use publicly available datasets from Kaggle:

World Happiness Report Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness
Contains global happiness scores, GDP per capita, social support, freedom index, and life expectancy.

World Bank Education Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/education-statistics
Includes literacy rates, mean years of schooling, tertiary education enrollment, and government expenditure on education.

Key Variables in the Dataset

Education-Related Variables

Education Index → Combines mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
Tertiary Enrollment Rate → Percentage of people enrolled in higher education.
Adult Literacy Rate → Percentage of adults who can read and write

Happiness-Related Variables

Happiness Score → Well-being index on a scale of 0 to 10.
GDP per Capita → Economic performance indicator.
Social Support Index → Measures the strength of community and support systems.
Freedom Index → Measures the perceived level of personal freedom.
Both datasets will be merged using the "Country" field to ensure accurate comparisons.

#Methodology

The study will follow a structured approach to collect, clean, and analyze data.

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Merge education and happiness datasets using the "Country" field.
Handle missing values using imputation or removal of incomplete records.
Convert categorical variables into numerical formats for effective analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms & Distribution Plots → Assess the spread of happiness scores and education levels.
Correlation Matrix (Heatmap) → Identify relationships between education, happiness, and economic factors.
Scatter Plots & Boxplots → Compare education levels across different happiness scores.

3. Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (H₀): No significant relationship exists between education level and happiness index.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher education levels are significantly correlated with higher happiness scores.
Conduct statistical tests (Pearson correlation, regression analysis) to test the hypothesis.

4. Machine Learning (Optional)
Train a linear regression model to predict happiness scores based on education variables.
Compare different models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) to identify the best predictor.

5. Expected Outcomes
Identification of potential correlations between education and happiness levels.
Insights into whether tertiary education enrollment plays a significant role in happiness.
Visualization of global trends linking education with life satisfaction.


#Hypothesis and Predictions

This study aims to test the following hypotheses regarding the relationship between education level and happiness:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between education level and happiness index. Higher education levels do not significantly impact happiness scores.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher education levels are significantly correlated with higher happiness scores. Countries with better education systems and higher literacy rates tend to have higher happiness levels.

#Predictions

Based on previous research and logical reasoning, the following outcomes are expected:

Countries with higher literacy rates and longer schooling years will have higher happiness scores.
Tertiary education enrollment will be a strong predictor of happiness, but other factors such as GDP per capita and social support may have stronger correlations.
Developed nations will show a stronger correlation between education and happiness, while in developing countries, economic factors may play a more dominant role.
